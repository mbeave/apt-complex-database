# Apartment Complex Database

This is an example relational database of an apartment complex built using Oracle Database 21c Express Edition, specifically with the SQL Plus editor/CLI.

These queries will work best with SQL Plus.

The database was designed first through an Entity Relationship diagram put together with draw.io.

Then, with the ER diagram as a reference, a data dictionary was made demonstrating the tables and their parameters.

Finally, the SQL queries were written, first creating the tables and views, then inserting the values into the tables, and then running some queries on those tables and views. The last query drops all the tables and views from the database.
